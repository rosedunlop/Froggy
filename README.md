Save Poppy The Puppy: This is my first project from the General Assembly Course SEI-59

To begin with I planned out my pseudo code for the HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

The layout of the HTML was quite basic, it has a header, a main containing two divs - one for the game specifics which is on the left hand side of the page and the game content which is situated on the right.
The game content is where the 10 by 10 grid is kept - where I made 100 divs in the HTML document itself.
